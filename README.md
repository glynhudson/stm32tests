# stm32tests

this repo is just some notes gathered whilst starting out with an STM32 MCU, in particular a nucleo-f303re board.

For notes about any particular project check for a README.md in that project's folder.

## Getting started

To compile and flash the firmware to a USB connected device and then view the serial output on a Linux box all that is required is the arm toolchain and a serial console like Minicom, both can be installed via apt-get

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arn-none-eabi minicom
```

once this repo is cloned or downloaded/extracted a project can be compiled by just running `make` from the chosen project folder

```
cd stm32tests/emonTxshield
make
```

to flash the firmware to a USB connected nucleo board using the on-board STLink v2.1 programmer/debugger, the `.bin` file found it the `build` folder that was generated by `make` can be copied to the "NODE_F303RE" USB storage device. The STLink v2.1 makes flashing very easy by presenting the nucleo board as a USB mass storage device (512Kb in the case of the F303RE) and any `.bin` file dropped there will be flashed to the target STM32 MCU by the STLink v2.1 automatiaclly.

```
cp build/emonTxshield.bin /media/pi/NODE_F303RE
```

The path to the "NODE_F303RE" may vary depending on the host OS in use, here Raspbian Stretch is being used an a Raspberry Pi 3 and it was autodetected and mounted by the OS.

To then view the serial output Minicom can be used

```
minicom -F -b115200 -D/dev/ttyACM0
```
if the serial output scrolls off the right hand side of the page, the "Add carriage return" setting in Minicom can be set with `ctrl-a` then `u`. to exit Minicom use `ctrl-a` then `x` and `enter` or to bring up a menu of options `ctrl-a` then `z`.

to make life a little easier an alias can be set up with
```
alias nucleo='minicom  -F -b115200 -D/dev/ttyACM0'
```
so that just typing `nucleo` will open Minicom with the correct path and baud eg
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ nucleo

Welcome to minicom 2.7

### For the less patient (including me) here is an all in one block of code

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arn-none-eabi minicom
alias nucleo='minicom  -F -b115200 -D/dev/ttyACM0'
git clone https://github.com/pb66/stm32tests.git
cd stm32tests/emonTxshield
make
nucleo
```
[this works on a Pi running Raspbian Stretch, you may get different results if (for example) the `git` and `make` packages are not already installed. Omit the first lines if tools already installed or the last lines if nucleo device not yet connected]
